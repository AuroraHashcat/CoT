Since there are 12 months in a year, the total yearly production is 420 units/month * 12 months/year = 5040 units/year.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total yearly production cost.\nThe production cost per component is $110. With 5040 units produced in a year, the total yearly production cost is 5040 units * $110/unit = $554,400.\n\nStep 3: Determine the total yearly revenue required to achieve the target yearly profit.\nProfit is defined as Revenue - Production Costs. The target yearly profit is at least $626,400. Therefore, Revenue - $554,400 >= $626,400. To find the minimum required revenue, we set the profit equal to the target: Revenue = Profit + Production Costs. So, the minimum required yearly revenue is $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the minimum selling price per component.\nThe total minimum yearly revenue required is $1,180,800, and this revenue is generated from selling 5040 components. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is $1,180,800 / 5040 units = $234.375/unit.\n\nStep 5: Compare the calculated minimum selling price with the given choices.\nThe calculated minimum selling price is $234.375.

The man saves 12 1/2 % of his income. 12 1/2 % is equivalent to 12.5%, which can be written as the fraction 12.5/100 or 1/8. Therefore, his savings are (1/8) of his total income.\nStep 3: Determine the portion of income that is spent. If 1/8 of the income is saved, then the remaining portion must be spent. The total income can be represented as 1 (or 8/8). So, the portion of income spent is 1 - (1/8) = 7/8.\nStep 4: Use the given spending amount to set up an equation. We are given that the man spends Rs. 3500 per month. From Step 3, we know that his spending represents 7/8 of his total income. Let 'I' be his total monthly income.

The objective is to find its perimeter.\nStep 2: By definition, a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. Therefore, if one length is 8 cm, the opposite length is also 8 cm. Similarly, if one width is 3 cm, the opposite width is also 3 cm.\nStep 3: The perimeter of any polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. For a rectangle, this means adding the two lengths and the two widths.\nStep 4: The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle can be expressed as P = L + W + L + W, which simplifies to P = 2L + 2W, or P = 2 * (L + W).\nStep 5: Substitute the given values (L = 8 cm, W = 3 cm) into the perimeter formula P = 2 * (L + W). This yields P = 2 * (8 cm + 3 cm).\nStep 6: Perform the addition inside the parentheses first: 8 cm + 3 cm = 11 cm.\nStep 7: Now, multiply this sum by 2: P = 2 * 11 cm = 22 cm.\nStep 8: Compare the calculated perimeter, 22 cm, with the given choices.

            "cot_output": "Step 1: Let 's' be the side length of the original square piece of cloth. The perimeter of the original square is 4s.\n\nStep 2: The square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. This means one dimension of the resulting rectangular piece remains 's', and the other dimension becomes 's - 4'.\n\nStep 3: The rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.\n\nStep 4: Since the two triangles together form the rectangle, the area of the rectangular piece of cloth is the sum of the areas of the two triangles. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 70 sq ft + 70 sq ft = 140 sq ft.\n\nStep 5: The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. Using the dimensions from Step 2, the area of the rectangle is s * (s - 4). So, we can set up the equation: s * (s - 4) = 140.\n\nStep 6: Expand and rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation: s^2 - 4s = 140, which becomes s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0.\n\nStep 7: Solve the quadratic equation for 's'. We look for two numbers that multiply to -140 and add up to -4. These numbers are -14 and 10. So, the equation can be factored as (s - 14)(s + 10) = 0.\n\nStep 8: The possible values for 's' are s = 14 or s = -10. Since 's' represents a length, it must be a positive value. Therefore, the side length of the original square, s, is 14 feet.\n\nStep 9: The question asks for the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth. The perimeter of a square is 4 times its side length. So, the perimeter = 4 * s = 4 * 14 feet.\n\nStep 10: Calculate the perimeter: 4 * 14 = 56 feet.\n\nStep 11: Compare the calculated perimeter with the given choices. The calculated perimeter is 56 feet, which matches choice 'a'.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{a}$",

            "cot_output": "Step 1: Identify the given information and the objective.\nWe are given:\n- Total number of books = 45\n- Number of hardcover books (H) = 30\n- Number of fiction books (F) = 20\nWe need to find the maximum number of books that are *both* hardcover and fiction (H ∩ F).\n\nStep 2: Understand the constraints on the intersection of two sets.\nThe number of items belonging to the intersection of two sets cannot exceed the number of items in either of the individual sets. This is because every item in the intersection must also be an item in each of the individual sets.\nTherefore, (H ∩ F) ≤ H and (H ∩ F) ≤ F.\n\nStep 3: Apply the constraints to the given numbers.\nFrom Step 2, we know:\n- The number of books that are both hardcover and fiction cannot be more than the total number of hardcover books. So, (H ∩ F) ≤ 30.\n- The number of books that are both hardcover and fiction cannot be more than the total number of fiction books. So, (H ∩ F) ≤ 20.\n\nStep 4: Determine the maximum possible value for the intersection.\nTo satisfy both inequalities from Step 3, the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two limits.\nThus, (H ∩ F) ≤ min(30, 20).\n(H ∩ F) ≤ 20.\n\nStep 5: Verify if this maximum is achievable.\nTo achieve the maximum of 20, we assume that all 20 fiction books are also hardcover.\n- If 20 books are both hardcover and fiction, this means there are 20 fiction books (all of which are hardcover). This is consistent with the given F=20.\n- If 20 books are both hardcover and fiction, and there are 30 hardcover books in total, then 30 - 20 = 10 hardcover books are non-fiction. This is consistent with the given H=30.\n- The total number of books accounted for so far is 20 (hardcover",
