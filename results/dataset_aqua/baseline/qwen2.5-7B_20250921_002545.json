We need to find the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation is 60°.\n\nStep 2: [Second deduction, building upon Step 1]\nAt 45°, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is equal to the height of the tower (since tan(45°) = 1). Let's denote the height of the tower as \\( h \\). Therefore, the distance from the car to the base of the tower at this point is \\( h \\).\n\nStep 3: [Third deduction, building upon Step 2]\nAt 60°, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is \\( \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\) (since tan(60°) = \\(\\sqrt{3}\\)). The car has traveled a distance of \\( h - \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} = h \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = h \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\) in 10 minutes.\n\nStep 4: [Fourth deduction, building upon Step 3]\nThe speed of the car is \\( \\frac{h \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10} \\) distance per minute.\n\nStep 5: [Fifth deduction, building upon Step 4]\nThe remaining distance to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60° is \\( \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\).\n\nStep 6: [Sixth deduction, building upon Step 5]\nThe time to travel the remaining distance is \\( \\frac{\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}}{\\frac{h \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10}} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}{h (\\sqrt{3} - 1)} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} \\).\n\nStep 7: [Seventh deduction, building upon Step 6]\nTo simplify \\( \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} \\), we rationalize the denominator: \\( \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{\\sqrt{3} + 1} = \\frac{10 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{10 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) \\).\n\nStep 8: [Final deduction that directly leads to the answer]\nThe time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation is 60° is \\( 5 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) \\) minutes.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\nConclusion: A\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",

Since Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob takes 9 hours, we can set up the equation for the total hours worked as follows: \\(7A + 9J = \\text{Total Hours}\\), where \\(A\\) is the number of toys made by Alex and \\(J\\) is the number of toys made by Jacob.\n\nStep 2: We know that \\(A + J = 35\\). We need to find a combination of \\(A\\) and \\(J\\) that satisfies both equations and also ensures that the hours worked by both are almost similar.\n\nStep 3: To have almost similar hours worked, the difference in the number of hours should be minimal. Let's express the total hours in terms of \\(A\\) and \\(J\\):\n\\[7A + 9J = 7A + 9(35 - A) = 7A + 315 - 9A = 315 - 2A\\]\n\\[9A + 7J = 9A + 7(35 - A) = 9A + 245 - 7A = 245 + 2A\\]\n\nStep 4: The difference in hours worked is:\n\\[|315 - 2A - (245 + 2A)| = |70 - 4A|\\]\n\nStep 5: To minimize the difference, we need to find \\(A\\) such that \\(|70 - 4A|\\) is minimized.

First, we need to calculate the amount of tea and milk in the 15% that is replaced. Since 15% of the 50% strong milk tea is replaced, we are replacing 15% of 50% milk and 15% of 50% tea. This means:\n- 15% of 50% milk = 0.15 * 0.50 = 0.075 or 7.5% milk\n- 15% of 50% tea = 0.15 * 0.50 = 0.075 or 7.5% tea\n\nStep 3: After replacing 15% of the tea with milk, the remaining tea is 85% of the original 50% tea, which is 0.85 * 0.50 = 0.425 or 42.5% tea. The remaining milk is 85% of the original 50% milk, which is 0.85 * 0.50 = 0.425 or 42.5% milk. Adding the 7.5% milk that was added, the new milk concentration is 42.5% + 7.5% = 50% milk.\n\nStep 4: Now, the solution is 50% milk and 50% tea. John replaces 10% of this 50% milk and 50% tea solution with more milk. This means:\n- 10% of 50% milk = 0.10 * 0.50 = 0.05 or 5% milk\n- 10% of 50% tea = 0.10 * 0.50 = 0.05 or 5% tea\n\nStep 5: After replacing 10% of the solution with milk, the remaining tea is 90% of the original 50% tea, which is 0.90 * 0.50 = 0.45 or 45% tea. The remaining milk is 90% of the original 50% milk, which is 0.90 * 0.50 = 0.45 or 45% milk.

This is \\(125 - 27 = 98\\) smaller cubes.\n\nStep 5: Each face of the hollow cube is a 3x3 grid of smaller cubes (since the inner cube is 3x3x3). The outer surface of the cube has 6 faces, so there are \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\) smaller cubes on the outer surface (3x3 grid on each of 6 faces).\n\nStep 6: Each face of the hollow cube has 4 edges (excluding corners) where the smaller cubes are shared between two faces.

            "cot_output": "Step 1: The sum of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers can be represented as (n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8), where n is the smallest of these numbers. The sum of these numbers is \\(5n + 20\\).\n\nStep 2: Simplifying the sum, we get \\(5(n + 4)\\). For this sum to be divisible by 10, \\(n + 4\\) must be even, which means \\(n\\) must be even. However, since \\(n\\) is a two-digit odd number, this condition is inherently satisfied because the sequence of odd numbers will always include an even number of even and odd numbers when taken in consecutive pairs.\n\nStep 3: The sum \\(5(n + 4)\\) must also be a perfect square. Let's denote the perfect square as \\(k^2\\), so \\(5(n + 4) = k^2\\). This implies \\(n + 4 = \\frac{k^2}{5}\\), and \\(k^2\\) must be a multiple of 5. The smallest perfect squares that are multiples of 5 are 25, 100, 225, etc.\n\nStep 4: Let's test the smallest perfect square, 25. Then \\(n + 4 = 5\\), so \\(n = 1\\). This would give us the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, which are not all two-digit numbers. So, we test the next perfect square, 100. Then \\(n + 4 = 20\\), so \\(n = 16\\). This would give us the sequence 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, which are not all two-digit numbers. We continue to the next perfect square, 225. Then \\(n + 4 = 45\\), so \\(n = 41\\). This gives us the sequence 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, which are all two-digit numbers.\n\nStep 5: We need to check if any of the given options can be part of this sequence. The sequence is 41, 43, 45, 47, 49.

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. Therefore, the population after one year will be \\( 1.1P \\), and after two years, it will be \\( 1.1 \\times 1.1P = 1.21P \\).\n\nStep 2: The problem states that the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. One year ago, the population was \\( P \\), so double that would be \\( 2P \\). Therefore, we can set up the equation \\( 1.21P = 2P \\).\n\nStep 3: To find the percent population increase over the last year, we need to determine the ratio of the population increase to the current population. Let's denote the population one year ago as \\( P_0 \\). The population one year ago was \\( P_0 \\), and the population now is \\( 1.1P_0 \\). The percent increase over the last year is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Percent Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Population} - \\text{Old Population}}{\\text{Old Population}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{1.1P_0 - P_0}{P_0} \\right) \\times 100 = (1.1 - 1) \\times 100 = 0.1 \\times 100 = 10\\% \\]\n\nStep 4: However, we need to find the percent increase over the last year, which is the percent increase from the population one year ago to the current population.

Since the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago, we have:\n\\[ 1.21P_1 = 2P_1 \\]\nThis implies that the population one year ago was \\( P_1 \\), and the population now is \\( 1.1P_1 \\).

If the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago, and the population increases by 10% each year, then the population one year ago must have increased by a certain percentage to reach the current population. Let's denote the population one year ago as \\( P_0 \\). The population now is \\( 1.1P_0 \\), and the population two years from now is \\( 1.21P_0 \\).
