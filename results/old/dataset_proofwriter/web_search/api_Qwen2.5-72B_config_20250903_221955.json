However, this does not directly tell us about the bald eagle's roughness. \n\nTo further analyze:\n- sent15: \"If someone chases the bald eagle then they eat the bald eagle.\"\n- sent13: \"The lion eats the bald eagle.\"\n\nFrom sent13, we know the lion eats the bald eagle. According to sent15, if someone chases the bald eagle, they eat the bald eagle. Since the lion chases the bald eagle (sent12) and eats the bald eagle (sent13), this is consistent with sent15.\n\nHowever, none of these statements provide information about the bald eagle being rough.

But there is no statement indicating that the bald eagle chases itself.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, there is no logical basis to conclude that the bald eagle is not rough.

However, we need to consider the logical implications of the given rules.\n\nStep 6: Consider the implications of Bob being both rough and white.\n- Since Bob is rough and white, and there are no rules that explicitly state that rough, white things cannot be green, we need to check if there are any indirect contradictions.\n\nStep 7: Evaluate the implications of Bob being young.\n- sent16: All white things are young.\n- Since Bob is white, Bob must be young (sent16).\n\nStep 8: Evaluate the implications of Bob being young and green.\n- sent12: Young, green things are smart.\n- If Bob is young and green, Bob would be smart.
