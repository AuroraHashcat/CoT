While the provided web evidence does not explicitly state this principle, it is a well-established scientific fact.

The height of the grass does not affect the creation of a shadow, which is primarily dependent on the presence of a light source and an object blocking that light.\n\nThe web evidence does not provide specific information about the causes of shadows, but the general understanding of shadows supports the rejection of choice B as a causal factor.

The statement \"The farmland needed irrigation, which implies that the natural water supply was insufficient for the crops to grow properly\" is a reasonable inference.

This is a common and well-understood principle in agriculture.\n\nWhile the provided web evidence does not directly address this specific reasoning step, it supports the general context of water supply issues in agriculture. For example, evidence [3] discusses the disruption in food systems from drought, which aligns with the idea that insufficient natural water supply can necessitate irrigation.

While increased financial resources might influence various life decisions, joining a church is a more personal and spiritual decision that is not typically a direct result of winning the lottery.\n\nThe web evidence does not provide specific examples or studies that link winning the lottery to either buying a yacht or joining a church.
