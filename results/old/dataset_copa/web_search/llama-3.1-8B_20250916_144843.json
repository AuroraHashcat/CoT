This is because shadows are formed when an object blocks light from a direction other than the direction of the light source.\n\nStep 3: The direction of the light source is crucial in determining the shape and orientation of the shadow. If the light source were located directly above my body, the shadow would be a small, circular shape. However, since my body cast a shadow over the grass, the light source must be located at a lower angle relative to my body.\n\nStep 4: The only time the sun is at a lower angle relative to the Earth is during the day, when it is not directly overhead. This is because the Earth rotates on its axis, causing the sun to appear to rise and set.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the sun must be rising or has recently risen, as this is the only time the sun is at a low enough angle to cast a shadow over the grass.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\nConclusion: A\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",

Similarly, [4] defines \"cause\" as \"to bring about an action, state, or response\", which also suggests a causal relationship.\n\nFurthermore, the reasoning step is logically valid because it is a deductive inference based on the definition of a shadow. The presence of a shadow is a direct result of the interaction between a light source and an object blocking the light, and the reasoning step correctly identifies the necessary conditions for the existence of a shadow.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning step is both causally and logically valid, and the correct answer is A.

The argument states that the customer's complaint is not a general dissatisfaction with the store or its products, as they would not have specifically gone to the store manager to report the issue. This implies that the issue is specific to the staff's behavior or actions, which is a plausible and logical conclusion.\n\nThe evidence provided does not directly support or contradict the reasoning step, but it does provide context and definitions related to the term \"common\". The definitions provided in evidence [3], [5] suggest that \"common\" refers to something that is customary, takes place often, or is widely used, which is consistent with the idea that the customer's complaint is related to a specific issue with the staff's behavior or actions.\n\nThe evidence does not provide any counterexamples or contradictory information that would reject the reasoning step as causally or logically invalid. Therefore, the reasoning step is accepted as valid.",
