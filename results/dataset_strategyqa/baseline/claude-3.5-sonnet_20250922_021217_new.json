The swastika is an ancient symbol consisting of a cross with arms of equal length, with each arm having a right angle bend, typically all in the same rotational direction. It has been used across many cultures worldwide for thousands of years before being appropriated by the Nazi party in the 20th century.\n\nStep 2: The Hopi are a Native American tribe primarily located in northeastern Arizona. To determine if they used a swastika-like symbol, I need to examine their traditional symbolism and iconography.\n\nStep 3: In Hopi culture, there is a symbol called the \"whirling logs\" or \"whirling log\" symbol. This symbol consists of a cross with bent arms, visually resembling what we would recognize as a swastika.\n\nStep 4: The Hopi whirling logs symbol has been documented in their traditional art, pottery, basketry, and ceremonial objects. It represents migration patterns, the four directions, and has connections to certain Hopi ceremonies and stories.\n\nStep 5: The Hopi whirling logs symbol predates the Nazi use of the swastika by many centuries. Like many indigenous and ancient cultures worldwide (including those in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas), the Hopi independently developed and used this geometric pattern.\n\nStep 6: After the Nazi appropriation of the swastika in the 20th century, many Hopi artists reduced or modified their use of the whirling logs symbol due to the new negative associations, though it remains part of their cultural heritage.\n\nStep 7: Based on historical documentation, anthropological research, and preserved Hopi artifacts, it is established that the Hopi did indeed use a symbol (the whirling logs) that is visually similar to what we recognize as a swastika.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\ntrue\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",

Adobe Suite (or Adobe Creative Cloud) is a collection of software applications for graphic design, video editing, web development, photography, and more. It includes programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and InDesign. These applications are primarily developed using C++ for performance-critical components, with some parts using other languages like JavaScript.\n\nStep 2: Now, let's identify what Life Is Strange is. Life Is Strange is a narrative-driven adventure video game developed by Dontnod Entertainment and published by Square Enix. It's an interactive storytelling game with choice-based gameplay.\n\nStep 3: Let's examine the game engine used for Life Is Strange. Life Is Strange was developed using Unreal Engine 3, which is a commercial game engine created by Epic Games. Unreal Engine is primarily written in C++ and uses its own scripting language called UnrealScript (in UE3) or Blueprint (in later versions).\n\nStep 4: Comparing the development frameworks: Adobe Suite applications are standalone creative software tools built with Adobe's proprietary frameworks and technologies. They're designed for content creation, not game development. Life Is Strange, on the other hand, is built on a game engine (Unreal Engine) specifically designed for interactive 3D experiences and games.\n\nStep 5: While both may use C++ in parts of their codebase (which is a common language for performance-critical software), the architecture, frameworks, libraries, and overall code structure would be fundamentally different. Adobe Suite uses frameworks for document editing, image manipulation, and creative workflows, while Life Is Strange uses game engine architecture for real-time rendering, game logic, and interactive storytelling.\n\nStep 6: The purpose and functionality of the codebases are entirely different.

      "cot_output": "I'll solve this TRUE or FALSE question by carefully analyzing what we know about Kane's Royal Rumble record and WWE champions.\n\nStep 1: I need to identify what Kane's Royal Rumble record is. Kane holds the record for most eliminations in a single Royal Rumble match with 11 eliminations (achieved in 2001). He also holds the record for most cumulative eliminations across all Royal Rumble matches with 46 eliminations.\n\nStep 2: However, there's another Royal Rumble record Kane holds - the record for longest time spent in a single Royal Rumble match. In 2006, Kane lasted 1 hour, 28 minutes, and 12 seconds in the Royal Rumble match.\n\nStep 3: The question asks if any WWE champions have outlasted Kane's Royal Rumble record. This means I need to determine if any WWE champion has spent more time in a single Royal Rumble match than Kane's 1 hour, 28 minutes, and 12 seconds.\n\nStep 4: In 2006, Rey Mysterio set the record for longest time spent in a Royal Rumble match at 1 hour, 2 minutes, and 12 seconds. However, this record was broken at the 2018 Royal Rumble when Daniel Bryan lasted 1 hour, 16 minutes, and 5 seconds.\n\nStep 5: In the 2023 Royal Rumble, Gunther (formerly known as WALTER) lasted 1 hour, 11 minutes, and 25 seconds. None of these times exceed Kane's record of 1 hour, 28 minutes, and 12 seconds.\n\nStep 6: Actually, I need to correct myself. Kane does not hold the record for longest time in a Royal Rumble match. That record belongs to Daniel Bryan (now known as Bryan Danielson), who lasted 1 hour, 16 minutes, and 5 seconds in the 2018 Greatest Royal Rumble. In the standard Royal Rumble, the record is held by Rey Mysterio who lasted 1 hour, 2 minutes, and 12 seconds in 2006.\n\nStep 7: After further research, I need to correct myself again. The actual record for longest time in a Royal Rumble match belongs to Gunther, who lasted 1 hour, 11 minutes, and 25 seconds in the 2023 Royal Rumble.

Kane's most notable Royal Rumble records are for eliminations (most in a single match with 11, and most cumulative with 46), not for time spent in the match.\n\nStep 9: The record for longest time in a Royal Rumble match is currently held by Gunther at 1 hour, 11 minutes, and 25 seconds from the 2023 Royal Rumble.

        "I need to identify what Kane's Royal Rumble record is. Kane holds the record for most eliminations in a single Royal Rumble match with 11 eliminations (achieved in 2001). He also holds the record for most cumulative eliminations across all Royal Rumble matches with 46 eliminations.",
        "However, there's another Royal Rumble record Kane holds - the record for longest time spent in a single Royal Rumble match. In 2006, Kane lasted 1 hour, 28 minutes, and 12 seconds in the Royal Rumble match.",
        "The question asks if any WWE champions have outlasted Kane's Royal Rumble record. This means I need to determine if any WWE champion has spent more time in a single Royal Rumble match than Kane's 1 hour, 28 minutes, and 12 seconds.",
        "In 2006, Rey Mysterio set the record for longest time spent in a Royal Rumble match at 1 hour, 2 minutes, and 12 seconds. However, this record was broken at the 2018 Royal Rumble when Daniel Bryan lasted 1 hour, 16 minutes, and 5 seconds.",
        "In the 2023 Royal Rumble, Gunther (formerly known as WALTER) lasted 1 hour, 11 minutes, and 25 seconds. None of these times exceed Kane's record of 1 hour, 28 minutes, and 12 seconds.",
        "Actually, I need to correct myself. Kane does not hold the record for longest time in a Royal Rumble match. That record belongs to Daniel Bryan (now known as Bryan Danielson), who lasted 1 hour, 16 minutes, and 5 seconds in the 2018 Greatest Royal Rumble. In the standard Royal Rumble, the record is held by Rey Mysterio who lasted 1 hour, 2 minutes, and 12 seconds in 2006.",
