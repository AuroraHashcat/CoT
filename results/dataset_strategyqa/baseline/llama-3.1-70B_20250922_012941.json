Alexander Hamilton had eight children with his wife Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton. Their children had children of their own, making Alexander Hamilton a grandfather. However, without specific names or details about his grandchildren, we cannot directly proceed from this general knowledge.\n\nStep 2: Determine if there is a notable or well-documented granddaughter.\nGiven the historical significance of Alexander Hamilton, his family, especially direct descendants, might be well-documented. One of his granddaughters, Mary Schuyler Hamilton (also known as Mary Schuyler Hamilton Sheafe), is documented in historical records. However, without further information, we cannot confirm if she is the specific granddaughter in question or if her husband worked with a lieutenant.\n\nStep 3: Investigate the husband of the identified granddaughter.\nAssuming Mary Schuyler Hamilton Sheafe is the granddaughter in question (due to her being a documented descendant), we would need to investigate her husband's professional life. Unfortunately, without specific details about her husband's career or interactions, we cannot directly answer the question based on general knowledge.\n\nStep 4: Consider the likelihood and relevance of working with a lieutenant.\nMany professions involve working with individuals of various ranks or titles, including lieutenants. This is particularly true for careers in the military, law enforcement, or other structured organizations. However, without knowing the specific profession or context of Mary Schuyler Hamilton Sheafe's husband, we cannot make an informed deduction.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the available information for a conclusive answer.\nGiven the steps above, we lack specific information about Alexander Hamilton's granddaughter's husband working with a lieutenant. The question seems to imply a specific instance or context that is not provided.
