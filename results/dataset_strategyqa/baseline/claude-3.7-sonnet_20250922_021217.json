Nickel boils at approximately 2,913°C (3,186 K) under normal Earth atmospheric conditions.\n\nStep 2: Identify Neptune's core temperature. Scientific models estimate Neptune's core temperature to be approximately 5,000-7,000 K (4,700-6,700°C).\n\nStep 3: Analyze Neptune's core pressure. Neptune's core experiences extreme pressure, estimated to be several million times Earth's atmospheric pressure.\n\nStep 4: Determine how pressure affects boiling points. According to physical chemistry principles, increasing pressure raises the boiling point of substances. This relationship is described by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the effect of Neptune's extreme pressure on nickel's boiling point. Under the millions of atmospheres of pressure present at Neptune's core, nickel's boiling point would increase dramatically from its standard value.\n\nStep 6: Estimate the actual boiling point of nickel under Neptune's core conditions. Given the extreme pressures in Neptune's core, nickel's boiling point would likely be elevated to tens of thousands of Kelvin – significantly higher than Neptune's core temperature of 5,000-7,000 K.\n\nStep 7: Compare the adjusted boiling point to Neptune's core temperature.

The founders were Colin Macfarquhar (a printer), Andrew Bell (an engraver), and William Smellie (the editor of the first edition).\n\nStep 2: Determine where the Firth of Forth is located.\nThe Firth of Forth is an estuary of the River Forth, located on the east coast of Scotland. It flows along the northern edge of Edinburgh.\n\nStep 3: Examine the geographical relationship between Edinburgh and the Firth of Forth.\nEdinburgh is situated near the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. The city of Edinburgh was established on a series of hills, with parts of the city having views of the Firth.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the likely locations where the founders lived and worked.\nIn the 18th century, Edinburgh's business and publishing activities were primarily centered in the Old Town and areas near it. The founders, being in the printing and publishing business, would have likely worked in these areas.\n\nStep 5: Assess whether these locations would have provided views of the Firth of Forth.\nParts of Edinburgh's Old Town are situated on high ground (including the Royal Mile), and from certain vantage points, the Firth of Forth is visible. However, not all locations within the city offer views of the Firth, and the specific workshops or homes of the founders might not have had direct views.\n\nStep 6: Consider the historical context of Edinburgh in the 1760s.\nEdinburgh in this period was still largely confined to the Old Town and was just beginning to expand. While some parts of the city offered views of the Firth, many buildings did not, especially in the crowded Old Town where many businesses were located.\n\nStep 7: Evaluate the available evidence for a definitive answer.\nWithout specific historical records of the exact locations where the founders lived and worked, and whether those specific locations had views of the Firth of Forth, I cannot conclusively state they enjoyed such views.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\nfalse\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",
