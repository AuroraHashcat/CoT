There are multiple places named Norfolk, including Norfolk County in England and Norfolk, Virginia in the USA. Since no specific location is indicated, I'll analyze the more internationally recognized Norfolk County in England.\n\nStep 2: Examine the geographic composition of Norfolk County, England. Norfolk is a largely flat county in East Anglia with approximately 2,074 square miles of land area.\n\nStep 3: Identify Norfolk's population distribution. While Norfolk contains the city of Norwich (population approximately 140,000) and several towns like Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn, these urban areas occupy a small portion of the total land area.\n\nStep 4: Analyze Norfolk's land use patterns. The vast majority of Norfolk consists of agricultural land, with farming being a principal economic activity. The county is known for its extensive farmland, natural landscapes including the Norfolk Broads wetlands, and numerous small villages.\n\nStep 5: Consider Norfolk's population density. Norfolk has a relatively low population density compared to urban counties in England, with approximately 1.2 million people spread across its large geographic area.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate Norfolk's economic base. Agriculture has historically been and continues to be a significant sector in Norfolk's economy, which is characteristic of rural areas.\n\nStep 7: Compare the rural versus urban land proportion. While Norfolk contains some urban settlements, these make up less than 20% of the total land area, with the remaining 80%+ being countryside, agricultural land, natural areas, and small villages.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\ntrue\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",

The city of Edinburgh was established on a series of hills, with parts of the city having views of the Firth.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the likely locations where the founders lived and worked.\nIn the 18th century, Edinburgh's business and publishing activities were primarily centered in the Old Town and areas near it. The founders, being in the printing and publishing business, would have likely worked in these areas.\n\nStep 5: Assess whether these locations would have provided views of the Firth of Forth.\nParts of Edinburgh's Old Town are situated on high ground (including the Royal Mile), and from certain vantage points, the Firth of Forth is visible. However, not all locations within the city offer views of the Firth, and the specific workshops or homes of the founders might not have had direct views.\n\nStep 6: Consider the historical context of Edinburgh in the 1760s.\nEdinburgh in this period was still largely confined to the Old Town and was just beginning to expand. While some parts of the city offered views of the Firth, many buildings did not, especially in the crowded Old Town where many businesses were located.\n\nStep 7: Evaluate the available evidence for a definitive answer.\nWithout specific historical records of the exact locations where the founders lived and worked, and whether those specific locations had views of the Firth of Forth, I cannot conclusively state they enjoyed such views.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\nfalse\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",
