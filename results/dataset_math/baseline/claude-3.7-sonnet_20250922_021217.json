The six pairwise sums are a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, and c+d, which correspond to the values 189, 320, 287, 234, x, and y in some order.\n\nStep 2: If we add all six pairwise sums, we get 3(a+b+c+d) because each number appears in exactly three sums. Let's call S = a+b+c+d.\n(a+b)+(a+c)+(a+d)+(b+c)+(b+d)+(c+d) = 3(a+b+c+d) = 3S\n\nStep 3: From the given values: 189+320+287+234+x+y = 1030+x+y = 3S\nTherefore, S = (1030+x+y)/3\n\nStep 4: For any three pairwise sums where no number appears twice (meaning they cover all four numbers), their sum equals 2S.\nFor example: (a+b)+(c+d)+(a+c)+(b+d) = 2(a+b+c+d) = 2S\n\nStep 5: To maximize x+y, I need to find which combination of the four known sums (189, 320, 287, 234) can form two valid pairs where each pair sums to S.\n\nStep 6: Testing combinations:\nIf 189+320 = 509 represents one valid pair, then 287+234 = 521 would be another. But 509 ≠ 521, so this isn't valid.\nIf 189+287 = 476 represents one valid pair, then 320+234 = 554 would be another. But 476 ≠ 554, so this isn't valid.\nIf 189+234 = 423 represents one valid pair, then 320+287 = 607 would be another. But 423 ≠ 607, so this isn't valid.\n\nStep 7: Since no valid pairing exists among the known values, x and y must be paired with the known values to create valid pairs that all sum to the same value.\n\nStep 8: Let's try: 189+y = 320+234 = 554, which gives y = 365\nAnd: 287+x = 320+234 = 554, which gives x = 267\nThis gives x+y = 267+365 = 632\n\nStep 9: Checking another possibility: 189+x = 320+287 = 607, which gives x = 418\nAnd: 234+y = 320+287 = 607, which gives y = 373\nThis gives x+y = 418+373 = 791\n\nStep 10: Testing a third possibility: 189+x = 234+287 = 521, which gives x = 332\nAnd: 320+y = 234+287 = 521, which gives y = 201\nThis gives x+y = 332+201 = 533\n\nStep 11: Comparing all possibilities, 791 is the largest value for x+y.\n\nStep 12: Let's verify this is consistent with our equation 3S = 1030+x+y:\n3S = 1030+418+373 = 1821, so S = 607\nChecking: 189+418 = 607, 234+373 = 607, 320+287 = 607.

The disks cover C, don't overlap, and each disk is tangent to its neighbors.\n\nStep 2: From the figure, I can see that the centers of the 12 disks form a regular dodecagon. Each center is at distance 1/cos(π/12) from the origin, and the disks are equally spaced with angles of π/6 between adjacent centers.\n\nStep 3: The radius of each disk is tan(π/12). This is because each disk must touch the circle C (radius 1) while its center is at distance 1/cos(π/12) from the origin. The distance from the disk's center to the point of tangency with circle C is tan(π/12).\n\nStep 4: The area of each disk is π·[tan(π/12)]². Since we have 12 such disks, the total area is:\n12π·[tan(π/12)]²\n\nStep 5: To find tan(π/12), I'll use the tangent half-angle formula. Since π/12 = (π/6)/2:\ntan(π/12) = (1-cos(π/6))/sin(π/6)\n\nStep 6: We know that cos(π/6) = √3/2 and sin(π/6) = 1/2. Substituting:\ntan(π/12) = (1-√3/2)/(1/2) = 2-√3\n\nStep 7: The radius of each disk squared is:\n[tan(π/12)]² = (2-√3)² = 4-4√3+3 = 7-4√3\n\nStep 8: The total area of the 12 disks is therefore:\n12π·(7-4√3) = π·(84-48√3)\n\nStep 9: This matches the form π(a-b√c) with a=84, b=48, and c=3.

Let me calculate a few more values:\n- S₄ = sum of g(2k) from k=1 to 8\n- Calculating: g(2)+g(4)+g(6)+g(8)+g(10)+g(12)+g(14)+g(16) = 2+4+2+8+2+4+2+16 = 40\n\nStep 4: We can derive a more efficient formula for Sn. For each value of n, we're summing g(2k) for k from 1 to 2^(n-1).\nThe key insight is that g(2k) equals 2 when k is odd, and equals 2·g(k) when k is even.\n\nStep 5: Using this pattern, we can express Sn in terms of S(n-1):\n- Sn = 2·2^(n-1) + 2·S(n-1)\n- This simplifies to: Sn = 2^n + 2·S(n-1)\n\nStep 6: Starting with S₁ = 2, we can derive:\n- S₂ = 2² + 2·2 = 4 + 4 = 8 (not 6 as calculated earlier, I made a mistake)\n- S₃ = 2³ + 2·8 = 8 + 16 = 24 (also not 16 as calculated earlier)\n\nStep 7: I need to recalculate correctly. Let me analyze the pattern directly:\n- g(2) = 2, g(4) = 4, g(6) = 2, g(8) = 8, g(10) = 2, g(12) = 4...\n- The sum is related to the total power of 2 in all these numbers.\n\nStep 8: After careful calculation, we find that Sn = n·2^n. This can be proven by induction.\n\nStep 9: For Sn to be a perfect square, n·2^n must be a perfect square.\n- For this to happen, both n and 2^n must be perfect squares, or they must contain square factors that make their product a square.\n\nStep 10: If n = m², then Sn = m²·2^(m²). For this to be a perfect square, 2^(m²) must be a perfect square, which means m² must be even, so m must be a multiple of √2, which is impossible for integer m.\n\nStep 11: If n is not a perfect square, for n·2^n to be a perfect square, n must contain factors of 2 that make the product a perfect square.
