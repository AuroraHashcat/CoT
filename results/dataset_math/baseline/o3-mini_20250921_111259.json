This means that for each index n, aₙ involves a factorial term plus the linear term n, entailing unique divisibility properties.\n\nStep 2: Write the consecutive terms explicitly. For aₙ and aₙ₊₁ we have:\n  aₙ = n! + n \n  aₙ₊₁ = (n+1)! + (n+1) = (n+1)(n! + 1). \nThis formulation shows that aₙ₊₁ factors into two parts: (n+1) and (n! + 1).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the sequence for small values of n to seek potential patterns in the gcd of consecutive terms.\n  For n = 0: a₀ = 0! + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1,\n  For n = 1: a₁ = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, so gcd(a₀, a₁) = gcd(1, 2) = 1.\n  For n = 1 and n = 2: a₁ = 2, a₂ = 2! + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4, so gcd(a₁, a₂) = gcd(2, 4) = 2.\n  For n = 2 and n = 3: a₂ = 4, a₃ = 3! + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9, so gcd(a₂, a₃) = gcd(4, 9) = 1.\n\nStep 4: Notice that in these examples the greatest common divisor is highest (equal to 2) when n = 1, and for n = 0, 2, 3 the gcd is 1. This suggests that the maximum gcd among consecutive terms so far is 2.\n\nStep 5: Reason that as n increases further, the factorial component (n!) grows very rapidly and tends to lower the overlap in prime factors between aₙ and aₙ₊₁. In fact, aside from the special small cases (like n = 1), the gcd tends to be 1, and no evidence indicates a larger common divisor for n ≥ 2.\n\nStep 6: Conclude that the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor among any two consecutive terms aₙ and aₙ₊₁ occurs when n = 1, yielding a gcd of 2.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\nConclusion: 2\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",
