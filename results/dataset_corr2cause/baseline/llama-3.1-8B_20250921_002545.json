                "However, we are given that C and D are independent given A and B. This means that the correlation between C and D is due to their shared cause A, and not because C directly causes D or vice versa.",

However, we are given that B correlates with C, and C correlates with D, but C and D are independent given A and B. This suggests that the correlation between B and D is due to their shared cause C, rather than a direct causal relationship between D and B.",
                "Therefore, we can conclude that the correlation between B and D is not due to a direct causal relationship between D and B, but rather due to their shared cause C. This means that the hypothesis that D directly causes B is FALSE."
