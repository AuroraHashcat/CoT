The probability of the alarm ringing increases from 1% to 47% when the husband sets the alarm, regardless of the wife's action.

The probability of the alarm ringing is 92% when both the husband and wife set the alarm.

To answer this, we need to calculate the conditional probability of the employee being fired given that the manager has signed the termination letter.\n\nFrom the given probabilities:\n- P(Manager signs termination letter and Employee is fired) = 37%\n- P(Manager does not sign termination letter and Employee is fired) = 14%\n- P(Manager signs termination letter) = 49%\n\nThe probability of the employee being fired given that the manager signs the termination letter is:\nP(Employee is fired | Manager signs termination letter) = P(Manager signs termination letter and Employee is fired) / P(Manager signs termination letter) = 37% / 49% ≈ 0.755\n\nThe probability of the employee being fired given that the manager does not sign the termination letter is:\nP(Employee is fired | Manager does not sign termination letter) = P(Manager does not sign termination letter and Employee is fired) / P(Manager does not sign termination letter) = 14% / (100% - 49%) = 14% / 51% ≈ 0.275\n\nSince 0.755 > 0.275, the chance of the employee being fired is actually larger when the manager signs the termination letter. Therefore, the reasoning step is logically invalid.",

This means that 69% of the time, the employee is not fired (100% - 31% = 69%).\n\nStep 3: For managers who sign the termination letter, the probability of the employee being fired is 67%. This means that 33% of the time, the employee is not fired (100% - 67% = 33%).\n\nStep 4: We can now calculate the overall probability of the employee being fired. This involves combining the probabilities based on the managers' actions.\n\n- Probability of being fired when the manager signs the letter: 61% * 67% = 0.61 * 0.67 = 0.4107 or 41.07%\n- Probability of being fired when the manager does not sign the letter: 39% * 31% = 0.39 * 0.31 = 0.1209 or 12.09%\n\nStep 5: Adding these probabilities together gives the overall probability of the employee being fired: 41.07% + 12.09% = 53.16%\n\nStep 6: The overall probability of the employee not being fired is the complement of the probability of being fired, which is 100% - 53.16% = 46.84%.\n\nStep 7: Comparing the two probabilities, we see that the probability of the employee not being fired (46.84%) is greater than the probability of the employee being fired (53.16%).\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\nConclusion: B\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",

Instead, it focuses on the definitions of probability, likelihood, and possibility from the web evidence, which are not directly relevant to the question at hand. The correct approach would involve calculating the overall probability of an employee being fired by considering both scenarios (managers who sign and do not sign the termination letter) and their respective probabilities.
