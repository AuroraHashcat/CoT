At the same time, there was an increase in local cultural events and a new social media platform promoting community activities.\n\nQuestion: What is the most plausible cause in this scenario?\n\nChoices:\nA. The new social media platform was solely responsible for improved social cohesion.\nB. The enhancement of public libraries created spaces that fostered community interaction and learning.\nC.
