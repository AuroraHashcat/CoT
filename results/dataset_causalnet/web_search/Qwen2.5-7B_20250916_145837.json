Around the same time, there was a global economic downturn and an increase in online business courses.\n\nQuestion: What is the most plausible cause in this scenario?\n\nChoices:\nA. Online business courses alone spurred the increase in entrepreneurship.\nB. The global economic downturn forced individuals to start their own businesses.\nC. The new tax law created a more favorable environment for small businesses, encouraging entrepreneurship.",

This suggests that the tax law could be a significant factor in the rise in entrepreneurship.\n\nStep 2: The global economic downturn and increase in online business courses are concurrent events but do not necessarily imply a direct causal relationship with the rise in entrepreneurship. Economic downturns often lead to job losses and financial instability, which might encourage entrepreneurship, but this is not the most direct cause in this scenario.\n\nStep 3: Online business courses can provide knowledge and skills necessary for starting a business, but they do not directly create the favorable conditions for entrepreneurship. They can be a supportive factor but are not the primary cause.\n\nStep 4: The new tax law, by reducing the financial burden on small businesses, directly incentivizes entrepreneurship. This is a more direct and specific cause compared to the global economic downturn or online business courses.\n\nStep 5: The significant rise in entrepreneurship is most plausibly caused by the new tax law creating a more favorable environment for small businesses, which directly encourages more people to start their own businesses.\n\nConclusion: C\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\nC\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",
