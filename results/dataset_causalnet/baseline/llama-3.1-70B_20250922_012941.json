To determine the most plausible cause, we must analyze the potential impact of each event on food security.\n\nStep 2: Reducing food waste (the initiative) directly contributes to food security by ensuring that more of the produced food is consumed, rather than being discarded. This action can lead to a more efficient use of existing food resources.\n\nStep 3: Sustainable farming practices can increase the efficiency and sustainability of food production. This increase in efficiency can lead to higher yields and better resource management, which in turn can improve food security by making more food available.\n\nStep 4: Advancements in food preservation technology can also contribute to food security by allowing for longer storage and transportation of food, reducing spoilage, and making food available over longer periods. However, this is more about maintaining the existing food supply rather than increasing it.\n\nStep 5: Considering the direct impact on food availability and the efficiency of food production, sustainable farming practices (Choice C) are likely to have a significant and direct impact on improving food security. While reducing food waste and advancements in preservation technology are also beneficial, they are more about optimizing the existing food supply rather than increasing it.\n\nStep 6: The initiative to reduce food waste (Choice B) is beneficial but might not be the sole factor, as it doesn't directly increase food production. Similarly, advancements in food preservation technology (Choice A), while helpful, are more about maintaining the existing food supply rather than directly contributing to an increase in food production.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the most plausible cause for the improvement in food security, given the concurrent events, is the increase in sustainable farming practices, as it directly contributes to a more efficient and sustainable food production system.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\nConclusion: C\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",
