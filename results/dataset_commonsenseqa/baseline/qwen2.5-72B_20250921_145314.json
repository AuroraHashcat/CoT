Therefore, vinyl is not an odd replacement for pants.\n- **Record albums (b)**: Vinyl is the traditional material used for making records, so it would not be odd to use vinyl to replace record albums.\n- **Record store (c)**: A record store is a place, not an object made of a material. Replacing a record store with vinyl doesn't make sense in the context of material substitution.\n- **Cheese (d)**: Cheese is a food product, and vinyl is not a material that would be used to replace food. Using vinyl to replace cheese would be highly unusual and impractical.\n- **Wallpaper (e)**: Vinyl is often used in wallpaper to provide a durable, easy-to-clean surface. Therefore, vinyl is not an odd replacement for wallpaper.\n\nStep 3: Based on the analysis, the only option where vinyl would be an odd replacement is cheese.
