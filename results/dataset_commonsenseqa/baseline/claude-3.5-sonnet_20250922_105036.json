            "cot_output": "I'll solve this multiple choice question step-by-step with logical reasoning.\n\nStep 1: Let me analyze what revolving doors do functionally. Revolving doors allow people to enter and exit a building simultaneously without creating a direct open pathway between inside and outside.\n\nStep 2: The question states revolving doors serve as a \"security measure.\" This means they must provide some security benefit beyond just convenience for two-way traffic.\n\nStep 3: Revolving doors provide security by creating a constant barrier between inside and outside. At no point is there a direct open pathway that would allow unrestricted access or escape.\n\nStep 4: Revolving doors also control the flow of people, making it difficult for someone to quickly rush in or out of a building. Each compartment typically fits only one person.\n\nStep 5: Among the choices, I need to identify which type of establishment would most benefit from these security features. Let me evaluate each option:\n- Banks contain valuable assets (money) and need controlled access\n- Libraries contain books but security is typically less stringent\n- Department stores focus on merchandise security, not building entry security\n- Malls are designed for high-volume traffic and easy access\n- New York is a city, not a type of establishment\n\nStep 6: Banks have the highest security requirements among these options. They contain cash, valuable documents, and sensitive financial information. Controlling entry/exit points is critical for banks.\n\nStep 7: Revolving doors at banks prevent \"piggybacking\" (unauthorized people following authorized personnel) and make quick escapes more difficult after a robbery.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\na\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",

Work refers to employment or occupation where people engage in activities to accomplish tasks, fulfill responsibilities, and earn compensation. The primary purpose of work is to complete assigned duties or projects.\n\nStep 2: Let's evaluate each option against the fundamental purpose of work:\n- Option a: \"complete job\" - This directly aligns with the primary purpose of work, which is to fulfill assigned responsibilities and complete tasks.\n- Option b: \"learn from each other\" - While learning can occur at work, it's typically a secondary benefit rather than the primary aim.\n- Option c: \"kill animals\" - This is not a general aim of work except in very specific occupations like slaughterhouse workers or hunters, making it not broadly applicable.\n- Option d: \"wear hats\" - Wearing specific attire might be required in some jobs, but it's not an aim of work itself.\n- Option e: \"talk to each other\" - Communication is a means to accomplish work, not typically the primary aim.\n\nStep 3: The question asks about the fundamental aim of people at work. While options b and e (learning and talking) are common workplace activities, they are means or secondary benefits rather than the primary aim. Option a (complete job) directly addresses the fundamental purpose of employment - to complete assigned tasks and fulfill job responsibilities.\n\nStep 4: Options c and d can be eliminated immediately as they don't represent common or primary aims in most workplace contexts. Option c is inappropriate for most work environments, and option d refers to attire rather than an aim.\n\nStep 5: Between the remaining options (a, b, and e), option a most directly addresses the primary purpose of work. People go to work primarily to complete their job responsibilities, while learning and communication are supportive elements that help achieve this primary aim.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\na\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",
