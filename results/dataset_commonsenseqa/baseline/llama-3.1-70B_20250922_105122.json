The first step is to recognize that committing murder is a serious crime with severe legal and social repercussions.\n\nStep 2: One of the most immediate and direct consequences of committing murder is the likelihood of being arrested, charged, and potentially convicted of the crime. This process often results in the perpetrator being incarcerated.\n\nStep 3: Given the options provided, we need to find one that aligns with the consequences of committing murder. Option \"a. go to jail\" directly relates to the consequence of being incarcerated as a result of committing murder. However, the question asks what committing murder could prevent someone from doing, not what it leads to.\n\nStep 4: Upon closer examination, we realize that going to jail (option \"a\") is actually a consequence of committing murder, not something that murder prevents. We need to find an option that represents an action or state that is prevented or made impossible by committing murder.\n\nStep 5: Considering the nature of the options provided, we can analyze each for its logical connection to the act of committing murder. Options \"b. cry,\" \"c. find god,\" and \"d. guilty conscience\" are emotional or psychological states that could potentially be a result of committing murder, rather than something prevented by it.\n\nStep 6: Option \"e. problems\" is too vague and does not directly relate to a specific action or state that is prevented by committing murder. However, upon reevaluation, we can see that committing murder could indeed prevent someone from avoiding problems, as it would likely create significant legal, social, and personal issues.\n\nStep 7: However, the question's phrasing suggests we are looking for a more direct prevention of an action or state due to committing murder. Given the options, none directly fits the bill as a clear consequence of committing murder that prevents an action or state, except when considering the inverse implication of option \"a\" - going to jail is a consequence, but it implies that freedom (and thus, certain actions) is prevented.\n\nStep 8: Reassessing the options with the understanding that we are looking for what committing murder prevents, rather than what it causes, we find that the question's framing might be slightly misleading. However, considering the intent might be to find what is directly prevented by the act (in terms of freedom or actions), we can deduce that the act of committing murder itself does not directly prevent actions like crying, finding god, or experiencing a guilty conscience. Instead, it's the consequences of the act that might prevent certain freedoms or actions.\n\nStep 9: Given the logical analysis and the options provided, the best fit for what committing murder could prevent someone from doing, in a more abstract sense related to the consequences of the act, is not directly listed as intended by the question's phrasing. However, if we consider the spirit of the question to be about the consequences of the act preventing certain states or actions, we might lean towards an option that represents a broad category of outcomes or states that could be impacted.\n\nStep 10: Realizing the complexity and potential ambiguity in the question's phrasing and the provided options, the most logical approach is to select an option that, based on the consequences of committing murder, could be seen as prevented or impacted.
