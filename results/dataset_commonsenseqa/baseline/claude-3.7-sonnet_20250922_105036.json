            "cot_output": "I'll solve this step by step to determine which option most benefits from a revolving door as a security measure.\n\nStep 1: Let me analyze what security benefits a revolving door provides. Revolving doors control access by allowing only one person or a small group through at a time, making it difficult for unauthorized people to \"tailgate\" behind authorized individuals. They also slow down entry and exit, allowing better monitoring.\n\nStep 2: Banks handle cash and valuable items, making them targets for theft. Security is a primary concern for banks, as they need to protect assets, employees, and customers. A revolving door helps control who enters and exits, making quick escapes more difficult.\n\nStep 3: Libraries primarily focus on providing public access to information. While they need some security for their collections, they don't typically handle cash or highly valuable items that would necessitate specialized entrance security.\n\nStep 4: Department stores and malls are retail environments focused on encouraging customer flow and purchases. While they have security concerns about shoplifting, they typically use other security measures (cameras, tags, guards) rather than controlling entry/exit at the door level.\n\nStep 5: \"New York\" is a city, not a facility type, so this doesn't apply as an answer to the question about building security.\n\nStep 6: Among these options, banks have the highest security requirements for controlling access and preventing quick escapes after potential robberies. Revolving doors specifically address these security needs while allowing regular customer traffic.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\na\n===FINAL_ANSWER_END===",
