            "cot_output": "Step 1: Consider the materials and construction of a standard baseball. A baseball is typically made with a cork and rubber core, wrapped in yarn, and covered with leather. These materials are chosen for their durability and ability to withstand significant force without disintegrating or exploding.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the forces involved when a baseball is hit by a bat. When a bat strikes a baseball, the force is distributed over the surface of the ball. The ball compresses and deforms, but the materials are designed to absorb and distribute this energy without failing catastrophically.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the likelihood of a baseball exploding under normal playing conditions. The design of the baseball, including its layered structure and the properties of the materials used, is intended to ensure that the ball remains intact even when subjected to the high forces generated by a powerful bat swing. Explosions are not a typical outcome of such impacts.\n\nStep 4: Consider extreme scenarios where a baseball might fail. While it is possible for a baseball to break or come apart if it is hit with an exceptionally high force or if the ball is defective, this is not the same as exploding. An explosion implies a rapid and violent release of energy, which is not characteristic of the materials and construction of a baseball.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on the analysis of the materials, forces, and typical outcomes. Given the design and construction of a baseball, it is highly unlikely that hitting it hard with a bat will cause it to explode.

These technologies do not require quantum computers to function.\n\nStep 2: Consider the role of quantum computers in space travel.\n- Quantum computers are advanced computational devices that can perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers. However, they are not necessary for the basic functions of launching and navigating spacecraft, which are currently handled by classical computers and control systems.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the potential future applications of quantum computers in space travel.\n- While quantum computers could potentially enhance certain aspects of space travel, such as optimizing trajectories or processing large amounts of data, they are not essential for the fundamental processes of space travel. These enhancements are supplementary and not a requirement for flying into space.\n\nStep 4: Determine the necessity of quantum computers for space travel.\n- Given that current space travel is successfully conducted without quantum computers, and that quantum computers are not required for the essential functions of space travel, it is clear that quantum computers are not a necessity for people to fly into space.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on the analysis.\n- The statement \"People need quantum computers to fly into space\" is not supported by the current state of space travel technology or the essential requirements for space travel.\n\n===FINAL_ANSWER_START===\nConclusion: B.
