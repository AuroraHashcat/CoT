This requires medical intervention.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the first possible effect - \"The nurse tested his reflexes.\"\nTesting reflexes is a neurological assessment that evaluates nerve function and neural pathways.

      "answerKey": "B",
      "cot_output": "Let me solve this step-by-step, focusing on what would cause slow service at a restaurant.\n\nStep 1: First, I need to consider what \"slow service\" means in a restaurant context. This typically refers to delays in taking orders, serving food, checking on customers, or processing bills.\n\nStep 2: For slow service to occur, there must be a mismatch between the restaurant's service capacity (staff, kitchen resources) and the demands being placed on that capacity.\n\nStep 3: When a restaurant has many empty tables (option A), this suggests the restaurant is not busy. With fewer customers to serve, the staff would typically have more time to attend to each table, which would lead to faster, not slower service.\n\nStep 4: When a restaurant is crowded (option B), the staff must divide their attention among many customers. Each server has more tables to manage, the kitchen has more orders to prepare simultaneously, and managers have more operations to oversee.\n\nStep 5: The crowded condition creates a bottleneck effect where resources (staff time, kitchen capacity) become stretched, directly causing delays in service.

Vacations generally require both available time and financial resources to fund travel, accommodations, activities, etc.\n\nStep 2: Let me analyze Option A: \"Her husband got laid off.\" If someone loses their job, this typically creates financial uncertainty and reduced household income. Being laid off usually causes financial strain rather than enabling discretionary spending.\n\nStep 3: A layoff might provide free time, but it simultaneously creates financial pressure and anxiety about future income. This situation would typically cause a family to reduce spending and save money, not allocate resources toward a vacation.\n\nStep 4: Now I'll analyze Option B: \"She received a salary bonus.\" A bonus represents unexpected additional income beyond regular salary. This creates a financial surplus that can be directed toward discretionary spending.\n\nStep 5: A salary bonus directly enables the financial means to afford a vacation without creating economic strain. The causal relationship is clear - the extra money provides the resources needed to fund the vacation.\n\nStep 6: Between these options, only B establishes a positive causal relationship that would enable a vacation.
