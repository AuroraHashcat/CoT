This suggests that the cause is likely related to something I ingested or did recently.\n\nStep 2: Since the stomach hurt is a sudden and unexpected sensation, it is unlikely to be caused by a chronic condition or long-term issue. This suggests that the cause is likely related to a specific event or action that occurred recently.\n\nStep 3: Given that I recently ate something, it is possible that the stomach hurt is caused by food poisoning or an allergic reaction. However, if I had eaten something that was likely to cause food poisoning or an allergic reaction, I would likely have noticed some other symptoms as well, such as nausea, vomiting, or hives. Since I don't recall experiencing any of these symptoms, it is unlikely that the stomach hurt is caused by food poisoning or an allergic reaction.\n\nStep 4: Given that I didn't experience any other symptoms, it is possible that the stomach hurt is caused by eating something that is simply difficult to digest. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as eating too much, eating too quickly, or eating something that is high in fat or sugar.\n\nStep 5: Since I didn't eat anything particularly unusual or out of the ordinary recently, it is likely that the stomach hurt is caused by eating something that is typically easy to digest, but which I ate in excess or too quickly. This suggests that the cause is likely related to my eating habits.\n\nStep 6: Given that I jogged on the treadmill recently, it is possible that the stomach hurt is caused by the physical activity. Jogging can cause stomach discomfort or pain, especially if I ate a large meal before exercising.\n\nStep 7: However, if the stomach hurt was caused by jogging, I would likely have experienced some other symptoms as well, such as fatigue, dizziness, or muscle soreness. Since I don't recall experiencing any of these symptoms, it is unlikely that the stomach hurt is caused by jogging.\n\nStep 8: Given that I didn't experience any other symptoms, it is likely that the stomach hurt is caused by eating something that is difficult to digest, such as birthday cake.
